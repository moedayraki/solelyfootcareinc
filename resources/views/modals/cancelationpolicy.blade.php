        We are committed to providing you with the highest quality foot care and therefore, it is important to keep your appointments. We have booked an appointment exclusively for you. We understand that sometimes events happen that require cancellation or rescheduling. We ask that you give a minimum of <b>24 hour</b> notice if there needs to be a change in your appointment. If our nurses come out to your home or you do not show up to your appointment without calling ahead of time stating you are unavailable a fee of <b>$35.00</b> will be added to your bill at your next appointment. If this is an ongoing issue your treatments will be terminated.
